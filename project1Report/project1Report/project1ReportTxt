I found myself often confused during this project.
To begin, CentOS seems to be discontinued and I couldn't find a good download
link. Additionally, when I intalled docker, the screenshots included in the
power point were outdated compared to the current docker. When I tried to
run Ubuntu, it would exit immediately and wouldn't allow me to use the
terminal. I was very confused by options 2-4 so I opted for option 1.
I was also confused on wether option 1 was available as the lecture video
seemed to imply that option 1 should not be taken. Another strange issue
that happened to me was after I tarred my project, the tar and the folder were 
both empty and I lost all my files and had to restart.

I believe I achieved all the deliverables. I was able to code the simple.c 
program. I opted to use Nano as my text editor instead of vim. Additionally,
I compiled the program with gcc and tested it with the GNU debugger.
I believe I adequately displayed my ability to use basic linux commands.
I also have experience using git from my previous internship and displayed
so in the git script as well.
